Practical programming exercises focusing on function implementation, prime numbers, factorials, and mathematical series expansions
Functions
**Exercise 1:**
Write a function that takes an integer N as a parameter and displays the even numbers between 1 and N.

Write a function that checks whether an integer N is prime. This function returns 1 if N is prime and 0 otherwise.

Define a function that takes an integer N as a parameter and returns the number of prime values between 1 and N.

Define a function that takes two numbers n1 and n2. The function returns 1 if n1 is a multiple of n2; otherwise, the function returns -1.

Define a function that takes two numbers A and B as parameters. The function displays the multiples of the number B that exist within the interval [1, A].

Write a main function that interacts with the user to use the functions from questions 1, 2, 3, and 4. Assume that the values will be entered by the user.

**Exercise 2:**
Write a function fact(int n) to calculate the factorial of an integer n.

Rewrite the fact(int n) function using a while loop.

Write a function puissance(int n, int p) to calculate the value of N^p, where n and p are positive integers.

Write a function binome(int n, int m) that calculates the coefficients: C^pn =n!/((n−p)!p!).

The series 1+x/1!+x^2/2!+x^3/3!+⋯ ,−∞<x<∞, represents a limited expansion of the function f: f(x)=exp(x) near 0. Write a function exp(int n,double x) to calculate the value of exp(x) using the above series up to an order n passed as an argument to this function.

Write the main program to test all these functions.
